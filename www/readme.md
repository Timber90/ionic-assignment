No problem, just undo.
Wanna calculate again?
No problem just press reset and start over.
Cant find the item on the list of buttons?

Over all:
Very simple little app. No major css design.
Simplisity is key.Meaning it is very easy to use.
Colour coding for different food groups and the seperation through
lists make it very easy to use and identify what food group you are on.
Example: Veg is green in the veg list.
